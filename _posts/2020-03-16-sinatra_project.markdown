This is the first time I've built a website.  I found a lot of frustrating problems using SQL.  It always had to do with column names.  For instance I could not get the password to work.  I tried and tried.  Finally after googling everything it was because the column name was :password, not :password_digest.  Another issue was when I was building out the type of each pokemon.  Again it would not register the type of pokemon.  Turns out that :type is a column name that already stands for something in SQL.  If you try to make a type column and not use it as intended it just won't register your strings.  HOW FUN!  
   At the end of the day it is cool to see something I built on a website that I could potentially share with friends.  As the course goes on I am feeling more and more confident in my abilities.  One day this will make more sense and I will be better for the journey.
